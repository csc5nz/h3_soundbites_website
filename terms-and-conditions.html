                            By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                            automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                            that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                            allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                            our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                            extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                            to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
                            versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
                            database rights and other intellectual property rights related
                            to it, still belong to CynCab.
                          </p> <p>
                            CynCab is committed to ensuring that the app is
                            as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                            reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                            its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                            charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                            clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                          </p> <p>
                            The H3 Soundbites app stores and processes personal data that
                            you have provided to us, in order to provide my
                            Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                            access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                            not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                            removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                            official operating system of your device. It could make your
                            phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                            compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                            that the H3 Soundbites app won’t work properly or at all.

                              The app does use third party services that declare their own
                              Terms and Conditions.
                            </p> <p>

                            You should be aware that there are certain things that
                            CynCab will not take responsibility for. Certain
                            functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                            internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                            by your mobile network provider, but CynCab
                            cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                            functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                            have any of your data allowance left.
                          </p> <p></p> <p>
                            If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                            should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                            mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                            be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                            the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                            other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                            responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                            charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                            (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                            you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                            using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                            received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                          </p> <p>
                            Along the same lines, CynCab cannot always take
                            responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                            make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                            battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                            CynCab cannot accept responsibility.
                          </p> <p>
                            With respect to CynCab’s responsibility for your
                            use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                            bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                            updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                            to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                            to you. CynCab accepts no liability for any
                            loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                            relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                          </p> <p>
                            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                            currently available on Android – the requirements for
                            system(and for any additional systems we
                            decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                            and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                            using the app. CynCab does not promise that it
                            will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                            and/or works with the Android version that you have
                            installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                            accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                            also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                            it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                            Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                            rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                            (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                            from your device.
                          </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
                            I may update our Terms and Conditions
                            from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                            periodically for any changes. I will
